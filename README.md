The requirement for this site was to create a single trivia form with multiple choice or true/false option that includes a countdown timer.

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

The player cannot pick more than one answer per question.

The site not only meets the  minimum requirements but includes a unique and fun theme for user enjoyment.
